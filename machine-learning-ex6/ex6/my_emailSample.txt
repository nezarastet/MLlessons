Dear Members and Friends of PSIG:
 
I invite you to join me May 9th to 12th at the Crowne Plaza Midtown, Atlanta, Georgia, USA for our 48th Annual Meeting of the Pipeline Simulation Interest Group (PSIG).
 
PSIG events will begin on Tuesday evening with an informal Ice Breaker Reception to allow attendees to renew old acquaintances and make new ones.
 
Starting Wednesday morning, our PSIG authors will present a series of 19 papers during the course of the conference on a number of highly interesting topics.  PSIG is also offering a Technology Showcase event on Wednesday afternoon for solution providers to demonstrate their latest software capabilities.  The full conference agenda can be found here.
 
Preceding the conference, we are again pleased to offer a two (2) day Pipeline Simulation Short Course (PSSC) on May 8th and 9th.  Sessions include The Pipeline Equations, Fluid Properties, Multiphase Flow, and Real Time Modeling.  Registration for the PSSC includes admission to the conference at no extra charge.  Be sure to register early as space is limited to 30 students.
 
As you can see, PSIG 2017 has a great deal to offer all who have an interest in pipeline simulation and is an event well worth attending.
 
I look forward to seeing you in Atlanta!
 
Sincerely,
 
Dr. Ivor R. Ellul
Chairman
Pipeline Simulation Interest Group
